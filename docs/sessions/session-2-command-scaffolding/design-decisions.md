# Design Decisions: Command Structure Scaffolding

## Design Decisions

### 1. Command Organization Strategy
**Decision**: Use hierarchical module structure matching the CLI command hierarchy.

**Rationale**:
- Clear mapping between CLI commands and code organization
- Scales naturally with command additions
- Follows established patterns from tools like `uv`, `cargo`, and `git`

### 2. Module Structure Pattern
**Decision**: Group commands by functional domain with shared utilities.

**Rationale**:
- Ruby version management commands share common logic
- Tool/gem commands have overlapping functionality
- Application management forms a cohesive unit

### 3. CLI Argument Structure
**Decision**: Use nested clap derive structures for type safety and documentation.

**Rationale**:
- Compile-time validation of command structure
- Automatic help generation and validation
- Clear separation of concerns between parsing and execution

### 4. Shared Logic Architecture
**Decision**: Create domain-specific modules for reusable functionality.

**Rationale**:
- Ruby version detection needed across multiple commands
- Installation/download logic shared between ruby and tool commands
- Configuration management used throughout

### 5. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Use domain-specific error types with miette integration.

**Rationale**:
- Clear error messages for different failure modes
- Consistent error formatting across all commands
- Rich context for debugging and user guidance

## Alternatives Considered

### Flat command structure
**Rejected**: Would become unwieldy with 20+ commands.

### Single monolithic module per command group
**Rejected**: Would create overly large files and poor separation of concerns.

### Generic command traits
**Rejected**: Added complexity without clear benefits for this domain.
