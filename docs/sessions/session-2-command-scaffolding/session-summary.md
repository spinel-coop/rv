# Session Summary: Command Structure Scaffolding

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully scaffolded a comprehensive command structure for the `rv` Ruby swiss army knife tool, organizing all planned commands from the README into a scalable, maintainable architecture.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Command Organization
- **Created 5 major command groups**: ruby, tool, script, app, gem
- **Organized 20+ individual commands** across these groups
- **Hierarchical module structure** that mirrors CLI command hierarchy

### 2. CLI Architecture
- **Complete clap derive structures** for all command groups
- **Type-safe argument parsing** with automatic help generation  
- **Nested subcommand organization** following established patterns

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- **Structured argument pattern**: Each command function accepts a single struct rather than multiple parameters
- **Placeholder implementations**: All commands show clear "not yet implemented" messages with planned functionality
- **Consistent error handling**: All functions return `miette::Result<()>`

### 4. Command Coverage

#### Ruby Version Management ✅
- `rv ruby list` (already implemented from session 1)
- `rv ruby install` (placeholder)
- `rv ruby uninstall` (placeholder)  
- `rv ruby pin` (placeholder with basic .ruby-version functionality)

#### Tool Management ✅
- `rv tool run <tool>` (placeholder for auto-install + execute)
- `rv tool install <tool>` (placeholder for global tool installation)
- `rv tool uninstall <tool>` (placeholder for tool removal)

#### Script Management ✅
- `rv script run <script>` (placeholder for dependency resolution + execution)
- `rv script add <gem>` (placeholder for script dependency management)
- `rv script remove <gem>` (placeholder for dependency removal)

#### Application Management ✅
- `rv app init` (placeholder for new Ruby project creation)
- `rv app install` (placeholder for project dependency installation)
- `rv app add <gem>` (placeholder for adding gems to project)
- `rv app remove <gem>` (placeholder for removing gems)
- `rv app upgrade` (placeholder for dependency updates)
- `rv app tree` (placeholder for dependency visualization)

#### Gem Development ✅
- `rv gem new <name>` (placeholder for gem creation)
- `rv gem build` (placeholder for gem packaging)
- `rv gem publish` (placeholder for registry publication)

## Technical Details

### Module Structure
```
src/commands/
├── mod.rs              # Command group exports
├── ruby/               # Ruby version management
│   ├── mod.rs          # CLI args and routing
│   ├── list.rs         # ✅ Working implementation
│   ├── install.rs      # Placeholder
│   ├── uninstall.rs    # Placeholder
│   └── pin.rs          # Basic implementation
├── tool/               # Tool management  
├── script/             # Script execution
├── app/                # Application management
└── gem/                # Gem development
```

### Argument Structure Pattern
```rust
pub struct InstallToolArgs {
    pub tool: String,
    pub version: Option<String>,
}

pub fn install_tool(args: InstallToolArgs) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### CLI Help Generation
- **All commands accessible**: `rv --help` shows all 5 command groups
- **Nested help works**: `rv ruby --help`, `rv tool --help`, etc.
- **Argument validation**: Clap handles all parsing and validation
- **Consistent descriptions**: Clear, actionable help text for each command

## Validation Results

✅ **Project builds successfully** with only minor warnings  
✅ **All CLI help generation works** (`rv --help`, `rv ruby --help`, etc.)  
✅ **Placeholder commands execute** and show planned functionality  
✅ **Argument parsing validated** for complex command structures  
✅ **Ready for incremental implementation** of individual commands  

## Next Steps for Future Sessions

1. **Ruby Installation**: Implement `rv ruby install` with binary downloads
2. **Tool Management**: Build the `rvx` / `rv tool run` auto-install system
3. **Script Dependencies**: Create dependency resolution for `rv script run`
4. **Application Management**: Build Gemfile manipulation for `rv app` commands
5. **Gem Development**: Implement gem creation and publishing workflow

## Impact

This scaffolding provides a solid foundation for implementing the full `rv` feature set. Each command can now be developed independently while maintaining consistent patterns and user experience. The structured argument approach will make testing and maintenance much easier as the codebase grows.

The modular architecture supports the ambitious scope outlined in the README while keeping individual command implementations focused and manageable.
