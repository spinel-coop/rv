# Minimal reproduction for transitive dependency bug in parallel compilation
# See: https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv/issues/452
#
# Dependency chain:
#   llhttp-ffi (has native extension)
#       -> ffi-compiler (NO extension)
#           -> ffi (has native extension)
#
# Bug: The dependency graph only tracks direct deps between gems with extensions,
# so the transitive dependency llhttp-ffi -> ffi is missed, causing ffi to
# potentially compile after llhttp-ffi (which needs ffi to be ready).
