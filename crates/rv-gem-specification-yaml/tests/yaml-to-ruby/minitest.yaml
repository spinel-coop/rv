  minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
  TDD, BDD, and benchmarking.

      "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were
       allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
       paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
       frameworks...

       I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable
       compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and
       thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity."

      -- Wayne E. Seguin

  minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
  It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
  readable.

  minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
  minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
  expectations.

  minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
  algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
  co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
  one!

  minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
  output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

  minitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language
  implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
  test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
  discovery.

      "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
       framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

      -- Piotr Szotkowski

  Comparing to rspec:

      rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

      -- Adam Hawkins, "Bow Before MiniTest"

  minitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:
  classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to
  learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like
  extract-method refactorings still apply.
