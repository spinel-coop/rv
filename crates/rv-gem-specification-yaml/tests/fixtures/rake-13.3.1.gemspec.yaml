  Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
  specified in standard Ruby syntax.
  Rake has the following features:
    * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax.
      No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
    * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
    * Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
    * Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.
    * Supports parallel execution of tasks.
